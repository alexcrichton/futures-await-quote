# futures-await-quote

This crate is a temporary fork of [dtolnay/quote][up]. The `quote` repository
isn't ready for publication yet but we'd like to publish the `futures-await`
crate. This is a temporary fork that will only be maintained for the
`futures-await` crate and it will be unmaintained as soon as `quote` is
published upstream.
